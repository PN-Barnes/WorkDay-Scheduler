# Work Day Scheduler

## Introduction 

Schedule out your work day during business hours using this app. This application allows a user to look at todays date and time and see what timeblocks are available to schedule. Each timeblock is color coded and will save a users input when typed into.

The base structure of the application was formulated within the index.html file. timeblocks were created using the bootstrap table modeling and text areas for the inputs. Each row is evenly split between one another and is interactive with the users input.

the functionality of the application comes from the script.js file where global variables are declared to point at id tags within index.html. Also in order for the time color coding and tracking to work, the implementation of moment.js was used to keep the schedule up to date. moment.js documentation and further reading can be found within the references section.
